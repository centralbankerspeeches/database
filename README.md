# Central Banker Speeches dataset

This repository contains the dataset of central banker speeches collected for Campiglio et al. (<a style="color:#0569b9;" href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024</a>). It features 32,359 unique speeches from 131 central banks, for the period going from the beginning of January 1986 (date of the first online speech by a central bank) to the end of December 2021.
To the best of our knowledge, this dataset represents the most comprehensive collection of speeches by central bankers. It has been built up by compiling all the collections available online (i.e. the BIS repository and 143 central bank websites), and supplemented for some institutions by digital and physical archives. 

The dataset is freely available for academic research and personal non-commercial use.
